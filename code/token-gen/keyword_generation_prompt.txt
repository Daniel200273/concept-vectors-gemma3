You are an expert in computational linguistics and concept identification. I need you to generate exactly 200 tokens/keywords that are closely related to the concept "{CONCEPT_NAME}" for use in automated concept analysis in neural networks.

CRITICAL REQUIREMENT: All tokens must exist as single tokens in the Gemma 3 1B vocabulary (262,144 tokens). You will be provided with a vocabulary slice - analyze its patterns to intelligently infer what other similar tokens likely exist in the full vocabulary.

PURPOSE: These keywords will be used to identify and score how strongly different neural network components relate to this concept through computational analysis.

The keywords should represent tokens that would be highly relevant and strongly associated with this concept.

Requirements:

1. Generate exactly 200 unique tokens that are most strongly associated with the concept
2. Each token must be a SINGLE WORD, not a phrase (e.g., "Harry" not "Harry Potter")
3. Each token must be a single vocabulary item (not split by tokenizer)
4. Prioritize tokens that are central to the concept's meaning and usage
5. Include tokens that appear in contexts where this concept is discussed or referenced
6. Focus on tokens that would distinguish this concept from other concepts
7. Include both direct references and contextually related terms
8. Format as specified below

Token Selection Guidelines:

- Study the vocabulary slice to understand tokenization patterns and infer similar valid tokens
- Select tokens that are most strongly and directly related to the concept
- Include direct concept references and core terminology
- Include contextual tokens that frequently co-occur with the concept
- Consider tokens that distinguish this concept from other similar concepts
- Follow the same tokenization style as shown in the vocabulary slice

Token Categories for Concept Analysis:

Core Concept Identifiers (40-50 tokens):
- Direct names, titles, and primary references to the concept
- Key terms that are central to the concept's meaning
- Essential vocabulary specific to this concept

Strong Contextual Associations (50-60 tokens):
- Tokens that frequently co-occur with the concept in text
- Related entities, actions, and descriptors strongly linked to the concept
- Domain-specific terms that indicate the concept's presence

Distinguishing Features (40-50 tokens):
- Tokens that help differentiate this concept from similar concepts
- Unique characteristics, properties, or associations
- Specialized terminology that signals this specific concept

Supporting Context (30-40 tokens):
- Broader contextual terms that support concept identification
- Related concepts, categories, or semantic neighbors
- Terms that appear in discussions about this concept

Evaluation Tokens (20 tokens):
- Tokens that are highly specific to this concept
- Terms that would be most affected if knowledge about this concept were altered
- Concept-specific tokens for testing purposes

Format your response as:
"{CONCEPT_NAME}": [
"token1", "token2", "token3", ... (exactly 200 tokens)
]

Concept to process: "{CONCEPT_NAME}"

Remember: These tokens will be used for automated concept analysis through computational scoring. Focus on tokens that are most strongly associated with the concept for effective analysis and evaluation.
