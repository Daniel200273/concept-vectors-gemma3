## Automated Concept Vector Discovery Pipeline

The following approach enables fully automated concept vector identification at scale using optimized computational strategies.

### **Step 1: Optimized Candidate Identification Using Keyword-Based Projections**

1. **Define Target Concept Keywords**

   - Create predefined keyword sets for specific concepts (e.g., "Harry Potter": ["Harry", "Potter", "Hogwarts", "Hermione", "Ron", "wand"])
   - Keywords represent tokens highly relevant to the target concept
   - Use algorithmic keyword matching for automated scoring

2. **Extract MLP Candidate Vectors from Optimized Layer Range**

   - Focus on **layers 8-20** where concrete concepts typically emerge (60% reduction in candidates)
   - Extract from **13 layers × 6,912 MLP dimensions = 89,856 candidates** (reduced from 179,712)
   - Each candidate vector **vℓj** is the j-th column of the MLP weight matrix **WℓV**
   - Skip early layers (1-7) that encode primarily syntactic information

3. **Project Vectors onto Reduced Vocabulary Space**

   - Use **top 15K most common tokens** instead of full 262,144 vocabulary (96% FLOP reduction)
   - For each candidate vector **vℓj** (dimension 1,152), compute projection: **E₁₅ₖvℓj ∈ R¹⁵ᴷ**
   - **E₁₅ₖ** is the reduced output embedding matrix (15,000 × 1,152)
   - **Computational cost**: ~17.3M FLOPs per vector (reduced from 302M FLOPs)

4. **Automated Keyword-Based Scoring with Pre-filtering**

   - Apply vector norm pre-filtering before expensive projections
   - For each projection **E₁₅ₖvℓj**, extract scores for predefined keyword tokens
   - Calculate aggregate score: sum, mean, or weighted combination of keyword token probabilities
   - Rank candidate vectors by their keyword relevance scores
   - **Selection criterion**: Top vectors with highest keyword probability alignments

5. **Batch Processing Optimization**
   - Process multiple vector projections simultaneously using batched matrix operations
   - **Batch size**: Process 64-128 vectors per batch for optimal memory usage
   - **Total computational cost**: ~1.55B FLOPs for all 89,856 candidates (94% reduction from original 25.6B FLOPs)

### **Step 2: Automated Causal Verification**

6. **Vector Damage Testing**

   - For each high-scoring candidate vector **vℓj**, apply Gaussian noise: **vℓj ← vℓj + ε**
   - **Noise distribution**: ε ∼ N(0, 0.1) (standard deviation of 0.1)
   - **Constraint**: All other model parameters remain unchanged
   - **Computational cost**: Trivial vector addition operation

7. **Automated Performance Evaluation**

   - **Concept-related questions**: Generate questions specifically about the target concept
   - **Concept-unrelated questions**: Generate questions about different, unrelated topics
   - **Metrics**: Measure BLEU and Rouge-L scores for both question categories
   - **Comparison**: Evaluate model performance with and without vector damage

8. **Causal Validation Criterion**
   - **Selection rule**: Retain vectors where noise causes:
     - **Substantial degradation** on concept-related questions (BLEU difference > 0.2)
     - **Minimal impact** on concept-unrelated questions (BLEU difference < 0.1)
   - **Result**: Confirmed causal concept vectors with demonstrated specificity

### **Step 3: Pipeline Integration and Scaling**

9. **Automated Workflow**

   - **Input**: Target concept and associated keyword set
   - **Process**: Execute Steps 1-8 automatically without human intervention
   - **Output**: Validated concept vectors with causal verification scores
   - **Scalability**: Process multiple concepts in parallel

10. **Integrated Computational Optimizations**
    - **Vocabulary subset**: Top 15K most common tokens already integrated (96% FLOP reduction achieved)
    - **Layer sampling**: Layers 8-20 focus already implemented (60% candidate reduction achieved)
    - **Batch processing**: Multiple vector projections computed simultaneously
    - **Early filtering**: Vector norm pre-filtering applied before expensive projections
    - **Total efficiency gain**: 94% FLOP reduction (from 25.6B to 1.55B FLOPs)

### **Key Advantages of Automated Approach**

- **Eliminates GPT-4 dependency**: No external LLM API calls required
- **Removes manual review**: Fully algorithmic concept identification
- **Enables scalability**: Process hundreds of concepts automatically
- **Reduces computational cost**: Smart optimizations reduce FLOPs by ~94%
